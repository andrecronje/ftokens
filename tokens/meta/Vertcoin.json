Billed as the 'The People's Coin', the Vertcoin ascribes primacy to keeping its mining functions decentralized, and seeks to allow anyone with a personal computer to join the Vertcoin network.\r\n\r\nTowards this end, Vertcoin has its very own 1-click miner, a program meant to make mining more accessible to the general public. In Jul 2014, Vertcoin released a wallet supporting Stealth Address transactions.","notice":"YoBit is currently trading an old chain of VTC.
