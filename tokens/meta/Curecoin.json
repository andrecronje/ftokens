Curecoin's goal is to accelerate research in the medical sciences relating to Cancer, Alzheimer's, Antibiotics, Diabetes, Huntington's, Ebola, Zika, HIV, Parkinson's, repurposing drug compounds, and Astrobiology. \r\n\r\nWith the Dec 2018 release of version 2.0, Curecoin claims to have become 90% more efficient compared to ASIC mining. Registered protein folding participants continue to receive distributions from the 'automated oracle' at Cryptobullionpools.com, with the premine balance cached in cold storage (visible on block explorers). The network has transitioned to pure Proof-of-Stake (averaging ~10% rewards annually), which works to secure Curecoin's network. \r\n\r\nThe Curecoin system leverages Stanford's* Folding@home distributed research software. As of 1 May 2019, Curecoin's folding team is ranked #1 on the global Folding@home network. Development is focused on faster transactions, increased security, collaboration with science blockchain consortium partners (like FoldingCoin), as well as supporting philanthropic projects through the Curecoin Project's 501c3 sponsor (Vision's Made Viable).","notice":null,"date_added":"2014-05-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
