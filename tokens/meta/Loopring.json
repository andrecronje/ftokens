This infrastructure consists of open source smart contracts, as well as off-chain matching and proving software. Loopring 3.0, leveraging zero knowledge proofs, reportedly allows for significant throughput increases of non-custodial exchanges while maintaining the security guarantees of the Ethereum blockchain. Loopring also offers an auction protocol called Oedax (Open-Ended Dutch Auction Exchange). LRC is the protocol token that is used on Loopring and Oedax to incentivize network liquidity and optimize exchange/participant behaviour.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0xbbbbca6a901c926f240b89eacb641d8aec7aeafd"},"category":"token"}
