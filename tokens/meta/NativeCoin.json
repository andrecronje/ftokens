NativeCoin is not exclusively intended for Tribal use. NativeCoin can also be used by private businesses, international shippers, and for private transactions.\r\n\r\nThe vision of NativeCoin is to enable outside entities to conduct business within the Native Sovereign Lands. The team believes that as more Tribes work to develop shopping centers, amusement/recreation centers, and entertainment venues, the need for a sovereign, secure, and liquid currency arises. NativeCoin is tailored to the emerging use cases that Tribes are creating in the gaming sector and other integrated Tribal Enterprises.\r\n\r\nWith NativeCoin, the goal is to enable Tribes to use, own, invest their own money supply, and host online gaming portals for international customers. It is the team's belief that this will allow tens of millions of gaming enthusiasts to reach Tribal casinos.","notice":null,"date_added":"2014-09-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
