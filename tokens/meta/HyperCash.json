It supports zero-hash proofs, DAO governance, and quantum resistance. HyperCash offers two types of wallets: white and black. White addresses are publicly viewable, while black addresses will remain private. The use of zero-knowledge proofs masks the identity of the sender and receiver while verifying transactions. Hcash uses a hybrid blockchain/DAG network and a hybrid PoW/PoS consensus model for governance.
