Using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) V3 for consensus, the Adultchain blockchain is reportedly able to provide fast transactions, minimal fees, an easy to use interface, and optional full anonymity through the Zerocoin protocol.\r\nAccording to the team, anonymity features, as well as the SwiftX (instant send) feature, are possible through the implementation of masternodes on the Adultchain network. There are currently 600 active masternodes (as of May 2019) helping to monitor and secure the network.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
