Powered by contracts on the Ethereum network, the peer-to-peer energy exchange platform, their most mature platform, aims to democratize the trading of energy with transparent systems that allow individuals and communities to select the source of their power. In their dual token model, POWR is the utility token that users would escrow in order to use the platform, whilst Sparkz represent electricity credits tied to local fiat for marketplace participants. Both are used to create part of an economy in which households that generate electricity can trade with their neighbors for a fair return.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x595832f8fc6bf59c85c527fec3740a1b7a361269"},"category":"token"}
