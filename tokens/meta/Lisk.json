Lisk focuses on user experience, developer support and in-depth documentations. Liskâ€™s SDK kit is written in JavaScript so as to allow developers to easily build blockchain applications on the Lisk blockchain and even deploy their own sidechain linked to the Lisk network. The open source Lisk blockchain platform is powered by Lisk (LSK) tokens and operates under the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus model to allow for its network to be secured by democratically elected delegates.","notice":null,"date_added":"2016-04-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
