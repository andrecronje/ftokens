LiquidApps launched a scaling solution for blockchain developers - a three-tier ecosystem called the DAPP Network.\r\n\r\nThe DAPP Network reportedly includes a provisioning layer of DAPP Service Providers (DSPs), who compete in a free market to provide services for developers building dApps. The DSPs provide a suite of tools such as extra storage capacity (vRAM), web oracles, free virtual accounts (vAccount), trustless/decentralized random numbers generator, and scheduled tasks services (CRON).","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-06-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1765,"name":"EOS","symbol":"EOS","slug":"eos","token_address":"dappservices"},"category":"token"}
