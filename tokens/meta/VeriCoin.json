Staking, incentivized through interest payments, validates transactions on the VeriCoin network. \r\n\r\nVeriCoin transactions are reportedly nearly instant (currently 10 times faster than Bitcoin). The team claims that -- upon the upcoming launch of the binary chain that pairs VeriCoin with Verium Reserve -- network transaction speeds will increase exponentially. The Dual Blockchain (or Binary-Chain) pairs a digital currency (VeriCoin) with a digital reserve (Verium). It reportedly secures and accelerates transactions by leveraging complementary protocol technologies (Proof-of-Stake-Time and Proof-of-Work-Time), into a blockchain system. The goal is to offer a comprehensive solution to ensure low cost, secure, fast, and scalable digital transactions.","notice":null,"date_added":"2014-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
