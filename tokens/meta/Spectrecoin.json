On 17 May 2019, the team implemented the Spectrecoin V3 hard-fork to activate “Proof-of-Anonymous-Stake” (PoAS), or ‘Stealth Staking‘. Anonymous staking is now live. According to the team, Spectrecoin is actively developed, with a roadmap that prioritizes privacy, security, and decentralization, with features such as default stealth addresses, stealth staking, and low-power mobile wallet staking in the upcoming Android wallet.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-01-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
