It was designed as an economic game with certain elements of gamification, where each participantâ€™s influence is determined by his Golos power and the intensity of its usage.\r\n\r\nInitially, Golos blockchain was conceived as a social network for journalists and bloggers of Runet, as an independent blogosphere and mass medium without censorship. The Golos blockchain uses the DPOS consensus algorithm proposed by Dan Larimer, which reportedly provides high transaction speeds and network bandwidth. Golos blockchain code is based on Graphene 2 codebase.","notice":null,"date_added":"2016-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
