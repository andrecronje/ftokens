Stealth intends to offer zkSNARK-based private transactions. StealthsQuantum Proof-of-Stake (qPoS) signing algorithm aims to set a new standard in the blockchain industry. With the goal of true decentralization, qPoS relies on economic incentives to drive performance. With 5-second blocks, qPoS aims to offer a fast, feeless, private, and scalable blockchain. Using XST, (Stealth’s native currency), transaction validators purchase their rights to process transactions and collect rewards for doing so. These rights are tokenized as transferrable, non-fungible assets called “StealthNodes”, each of which is given slots in a schedule of block validation. This scheduling is intended to make Stealth efficient.\r\n\r\nStealth R&D LLC is the development company behind the Stealth blockchain.  Headquartered in Delaware, Stealth maintains offices in the U.S., Switzerland and Costa Rica.","notice":null,"date_added":"2014-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
