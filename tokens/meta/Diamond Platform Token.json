It offers multiple services, viz. Digital Diamond Data Base, Marketplace, Stablecoin [CDC], and Diamond Origin Verification Service. The CDC stablecoin is reportedly backed by 0.05 cts diamond and redeemable for an investment class diamond at the Diamond Network Marketplace.  The purpose of the DPT token is to confer digital access rights to the Diamond Network Platform and its services on a blockchain-based infrastructure. Service fees are collected in DPT. The token will have a governance function, where token holders will be able to vote on decisions related to the project's development.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x10c71515602429c19d53011ea7040b87a4894838"},"category":"token"}
