Launched in 2016, Espers leverages a hybrid POW/POS consensus mechanism. The chain relies on a project-developed HMQ1725 specification (modified qark - 17 algorithims hashed 25 times), providing ASIC-resistance and modern mining experiences on existing AMD and NVIDIA hardware. Additionally, holding Espers in its desktop wallet offers opportunities to receive staking rewards. The project is working towards a free and open internet that is removed from censorship and governmental risk.","notice":null,"date_added":"2016-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
