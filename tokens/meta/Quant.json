The solutions offered by Quant include Overledger OS and GoVerify.\r\n\r\nAccording to the whitepaper, the initial goals of the Overledger project were to develop an interface to connect the worldâ€™s networks to multiple blockchains, bridge existing networks to new blockchains, and to develop a blockchain operating system with a protocol and platform that allows developers to create next-generation multi-chain applications.\r\n\r\nTheir proposition for GoVerify is to allow people to verify and check whether any emails, SMS, mail, or phone calls received appear as legitimate and actually from the stated sender.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-08-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x4a220e6096b25eadb88358cb44068a3248254675"},"category":"token"}
