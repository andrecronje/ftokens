The goal is to allow users to access the blockchain for mining from any device. WebDollar reportedly offers a hybrid browser mining, where blocks are mined with a hybrid algorithm using 66,(6)% PoS and 33,(3)% PoW which is ASIC-resistant and features a GPU-unfriendly hash function, Argon2d.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
