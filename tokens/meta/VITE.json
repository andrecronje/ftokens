Vite uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture with delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. To reduce the security risks associated with DAG, Vite incorporates its Snapshot Chain technology.  \r\n\r\nThe core of Vite's platform features asynchronous architecture, which reportedly allows for the (i)  separate writing of requests and responses, (ii) transaction writing and confirmation, and (iii) communication between contracts. For dApp development, Vite utilizes the Solidity++ smart contract language.\r\n\r\nVite aims to provide a complete ecosystem of products to accommodate everyday users, traders, and developers. Currently, its product suite includes a wallet, DEX (currently in beta), and a payment network. Vite is working on a comprehensive set of SDKs that will allow developers to easily build dApps on its platform.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
