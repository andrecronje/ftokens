The SAFE network is a sharing economy for digital resources, that seeks to “create a secure, autonomous, data-centric, peer-to-peer network as an alternative to the current server-centric model.” The network is comprised of two main users: “clients” who access the various features of the network, such as browsing, storing data, or transferring money, and “farmers” who look after the clients’ data until it’s needed, at which point they might receive a reward for their efforts.","notice":null,"date_added":"2014-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":83,"name":"Omni","symbol":"OMNI","slug":"omni","token_address":"3"},"category":"token"}
