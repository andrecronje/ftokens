User-controlled private keys give the assertion that no third parties should have access to or control over data stored on the network. As a result, the cloud storage marketplace made available to users of the Sia blockchain is meant to be highly redundant, completely private, and more affordable than many alternatives.","notice":null,"date_added":"2015-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
