These are offshoots of Spend.com, which aims to give users a multi-currency digital wallet to buy, sell, store, manage, and exchange multiple fiat and digital assets. The Spend App is available on the Apple iOS App Store and Google Play Store.\r\n\r\nThe Spend Card is a Visa card that reportedly allows users to spend funds loaded in the Spend Wallet via the Spend App at over 40+ million locations that accept Visa. Users can reportedly use the Spend Card on Apple and Google Pay as well. The Spend reward system is powered by Spendcoins, created by the Spend Foundation.\r\n\r\nSpendcoins may also be redeemable for Gift Cards, Discounts, Memberships, or spent to fiat at 40+ million locations worldwide. Spendcoin will be the native currency on Spendchain, a reportedly high-speed interoperable payments blockchain that will be used to secure the network and process transactions.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0xddd460bbd9f79847ea08681563e8a9696867210c"},"category":"token"}
