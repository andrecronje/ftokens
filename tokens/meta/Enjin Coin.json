Enjinâ€™s tools and services can also be used by companies seeking to create blockchain products or utilize tokenized digital assets as part of their acquisition, retention, engagement, and monetization strategies.\r\n\r\nThe Enjin ecosystem is fueled by Enjin Coin (ENJ), an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency used to directly back the value of blockchain assets. \r\n\r\nAccording to the team, there are currently millions of ENJ locked in blockchain-based digital assets. \r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit https://enjin.io.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0xf629cbd94d3791c9250152bd8dfbdf380e2a3b9c"},"category":"token"}
