The project has created an Open Economic Framework (OEF) that serves as a decentralized search and a value exchange platform for various autonomous economic agents. This is supported by a smart ledger that can reportedly support more than 30,000 transactions per second, and which is intended to meet the demands of the next generation of connected devices. Fetch.ai has digital intelligence at its heart: it aims to deliver actionable predictions, instant trust information, enable the construction of robust collaborative models, and improve efficiencies and streamlining processes.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x1d287cc25dad7ccaf76a26bc660c5f7c8e2a05bd"},"category":"token"}
