Token issuers stake SWM when issuing a security token on any integrated blockchain (Ethereum, Stellar, or TRON), and SWM is staked to own and operate Swarm Masternodes, which maintain Market Access Protocol (MAP) and facilitate the compliant transfer of digital securities. Token holders may use SWM for community governance of the network, and SWM can also be used, alongside many other cryptocurrencies, for fundraising and settlement with service providers across the MAP network. Swarm's vision is to improve access to financial investment opportunities by promoting and supporting the tokenization of assets, and by providing infrastructure for free.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-02-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x3505f494c3f0fed0b594e01fa41dd3967645ca39"},"category":"token"}
