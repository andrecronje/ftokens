In this virtual world, users purchase plots of land that they can later navigate, build upon, and monetize. Decentraland uses two tokens: MANA and LAND. MANA is an ERC20 token that must be burned to acquire non-fungible ERC721 LAND tokens.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942"},"category":"token"}
