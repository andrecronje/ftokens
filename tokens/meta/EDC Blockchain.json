All EDC holders are reportedly merged into masternodes (a type of fund in which users donate their coins), thereby allowing the node to mine EDC. Based on a hybrid LPoS mining algorithm and using Bitshares 2.0 Graphene protocol, EDC reportedly provides network security when implementing important functions, such as instant confirmation of transactions and network voting. The last EDC coin will be produced on January 1st, 2040. The EDC community reportedly exceeds 1 million users, while the cryptocurrency is used by people in 57 countries. EDC is actively focusing on the Southeast Asian, Latin American, and European markets.","notice":null,"date_added":"2016-08-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
