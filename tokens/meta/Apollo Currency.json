Apollo claims to not suffer from blockchain sustainability issues, such as blockchain bloat. Nearly every blockchain on the market grows in size as its transaction speeds get slower. Apollo reportedly gets faster the more users that are on the system and its database can reportedly grow to unlimited sizes due to technologies incorporated into it, such as sharding, adaptive forging, and node time synchronization. \r\n\r\nApollo views itself as one of the first sustainable blockchains on Earth.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
