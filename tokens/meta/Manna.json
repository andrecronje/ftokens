The goal is to enable greater decentralization and wider scale distribution of the asset to larger numbers of people. Further, it allows for more global accessibility resulting in better long term adoption. Manna claims to be one of the first cryptocurrencies to be managed by a US based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. In order to receive the Manna basic income, users must sign up on Mannabase.com. Mannabase.com is a social platform that rewards users for their participation, gamifies giving, and aims to inspire meaningful connections. The project aims to create a 'web of trust identity network' and reward users of the platform with the weekly social dividend (universal basic income) in the form of the digital token Manna. From there, users will be able to support one another's content, trade goods and services in their online marketplace, and create a giving portfolio that distributes value to individuals, organizations, and targeted groups of the user's choosing.","notice":null,"date_added":"2015-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
