These settings reportedly reduce the chances of being identified and traced by blockchain statistical analysis. The Ryo developers implemented a uniform transaction ID system that hides the use of payment IDs because all transactions now have a uniform ID that is retrofitted with the old payment ID system. The team claims that Ryo is the first amongst various Cryptonote currencies to implement this feature, which addresses the metadata leak that reportedly affects Cryptonote coins with payment IDs. \r\n\r\nRyo aims to function as a store of value that is suitable for highly confidential transactions. The core mission of the project is to deliver a currency with true fungibility. This means that each coin is equal and interchangeable; the team claims that it is highly unlikely that any coin can ever by blacklisted due to previous transactions.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-07-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
