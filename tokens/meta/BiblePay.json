The project is passionate about spreading the gospel of Jesus, having the entire KJV bible compiled in its hashing algorithm (POBH).  BiblePay (BBP) is deflationary, decreasing its emissions by 19.5% per year. \r\n\r\nThe project views itself as a utility that provides an alternative method for giving to charity.  With Generic Smart Contracts, the project seeks to become the go-to wallet for Christians.  In the future, the team intends to lease file space on its Sanctuaries and release corporate integration features, such as c# access to the blockchain. The BiblePay platform is a derivative of Dash-Evolution.  Located in Dallas, TX, the team seeks to help orphans globally.
