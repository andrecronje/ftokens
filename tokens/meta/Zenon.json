The protocol differs from traditional blockchain consensus as transactions are not treated in batches, but asynchronously processed within shards, with the overall state of the network verified and validated at the end of each epoch (each epoch having a random timeframe). The network will also feature a Turing complete scripting language that will allow developers to build and run zApps, create digital assets, and allow low-resource devices to participate in the network.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
