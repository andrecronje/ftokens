Kuende's Gamified Challenges actively encourage people to engage in activities that lead to real-life interactions. \r\n\r\nKuende’s economy relies on 2 tokens: the Kpoints, which act as a digital currency in the platform and the KUE Token, a cryptocurrency that gives users and businesses extra benefits. Both the KUE Token and Kpoints are a means of incentivizing users and businesses to engage with the platform and each other in the digital space and in real life. \r\n\r\nKuende is also building its own blockchain on the Cosmos Network, with a view towards cross-chain interoperability. This is part of Kuende goal of empowering blockchain businesses to engage with their audiences through challenges and reward participants both in their token and Kuende’s.
