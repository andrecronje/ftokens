Some examples include self-sovereign identity, verifiable claims and credentials, along with secure and private communication and trust solutions. IOPâ€™s protocols are reportedly built with the up-to-date cryptographic technologies and secured via the IOP blockchain and its utility coin, IOP.\r\n\r\nIOP is open source and aims to follow international standards provided by organizations such as W3C to ensure maximum interoperability and to allow developers to more easily create their own software powered by the IOP stack.","notice":null,"date_added":"2016-11-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
