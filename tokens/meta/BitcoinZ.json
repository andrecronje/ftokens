BitcoinZ has also committed itself to always being GPU mineable and ASIC-resistant. BitcoinZ uses zkSNARKs for privacy (similar to ZCash).\r\n\r\nBitcoinZ prides itself on 100% community inclusion - the community posts open and public proposals for change that are voted on. Progress is achieved by volunteerism, with some proposals seeking a budget from community donations - mostly from member mining activities and pools supporting the project by setting their pools to auto-donate.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
