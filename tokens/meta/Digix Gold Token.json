The project provides the infrastructure to create tokens backed by physical assets on the blockchain. To wit, it allows for the public verification of an assetâ€™s existence through its chain of custody via its Proof of Provenance (PoP) protocol, which makes use of the Ethereum network and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). \r\n\r\nDigix also offers an API that enables other applications to be built on top of its asset tokenization service. \r\n\r\nDigix has 2 cryptocurrencies, Digix Gold (DGX) and DigixDAO (DGD). \r\n\r\nThe company reportedly procures its gold from LBMA-approved refiners. For security, Digix includes third-party auditing from Bureau Veritas. The DGD crowdsale in Mar 2016 was the first crowdsale and major DAO hosted on the Ethereum network.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-05-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x4f3afec4e5a3f2a6a1a411def7d7dfe50ee057bf"},"category":"token"}
