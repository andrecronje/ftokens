According to the team, BlockStamp is a fork of Bitcoin that has been optimized for three specific use cases: \r\n\r\n1 - Data sealing - both document storage up to 1 MB and timestamping\r\n2 - Censorship-resistant web publishing via a blockchain domain registry\r\n3 - Gambling edutainment - players can learn about gambling odds and test betting strategies in a provably fair platform with randomness generated via the blockchain's hashes. \r\n\r\nBlockStamp also natively hosts the BST crypto coin and has partnered with Hprox, a peer-to-peer proxy sharing network. Users can be paid in BST for sharing their residential IP address with the network.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-06-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
