Self-funded by a community of volunteers, NavCoin launched in April 2014 with no Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or pre-mine. Volunteers can propose contributions and get paid for work through NavCoin’s decentralised Community Fund (CF). \r\n\r\nWith the CF’s dual consensus mechanism, the funding of a passed proposal will be locked while waiting for its work to be completed and then paid out if the quorum is met. Examples of CF proposals include www.navexplorer.com, the NEXT wallet, the implementation of ZeroCT (a privacy protocol), and the time when NAV became a carbon-neutral cryptocurrency. NavCoin has also added support for OpenAlias (www.openalias.org), Cold Staking to the NavCoin protocol, and released NavPay, a light wallet to store and spend NAV from a mobile device.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about NavCoin, please visit www.navcoin.org.","notice":null,"date_added":"2014-06-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
