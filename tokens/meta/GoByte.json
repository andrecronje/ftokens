The idea behind the `GoByte Network` is to leverage encryption software to allow people to make financial transfers between computers. Its first platform, `GoByte Pay`, is an online payment service that allows individuals and businesses to transfer funds electronically. \r\n\r\nGoByte features masternodes and enables near-instant, secure, and anonymous transactions. Transactions on the network (dubbed InstantSend technology) take an average of 3 seconds to complete. The anonymous transactions (dubbed PrivateSend technology) mixes funds through the masternode network to obscure their origin.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
