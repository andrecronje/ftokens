Their mission was to present a local alternative to the Euro and Bitcoin. In July 2014, a group of volunteers set up the Electroniic Gulden foundation. The current focus of the Electronic Gulden Foundation is community building, especially within the Dutch community.\r\n\r\nIts approach towards addressing the 51% attack vulnerability inherent in PoW coins was through the use of an \"oeruschield\" extension, named after two e-Gulden core-developers. This shield entails \"identified mining\". Dutch companies registered with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce can reportedly request certification to be allowed to operate a certified mining pool,1 in 6 e-gulden blocks must be mined by a certified mining pool. Currently, 3 such pools are operational. These mining pools reportedly control 1/6 of the e-gulden network difficulty.","notice":null,"date_added":"2014-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
