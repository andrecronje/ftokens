Consumer goods inside the ecosystem are secured from counterfeit attempts through banking-level, tamper-proof NFC smart-labels, which are linked to their digital representations on the blockchain. Consumers touch the label with their smartphones to verify a product’s authenticity, discover the product’s journey along the supply chain, and are rewarded for their purchases with the Tael token. Tael is used as a payment method across the Tael ecosystem and its partners.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-12-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x286bda1413a2df81731d4930ce2f862a35a609fe"},"category":"token"}
