The technology is designed to be decentralized, reliable, secure, and scalable. It is based on Proof Of Stake, which was designed to reduce operating costs and carbon footprint.\r\n\r\nCloakcoin uses onion routing enabled by default with ENIGMA速 technology. This, coupled with CloakShield速 function, reportedly provides end-to-end encryption and offers direct and secure communication that allows nodes to evade traffic analysis. Combined with ENIGMA速, Cloakcoin aims to offer a high level of confidentiality that uses up to 25 jumps with symmetric RSA encryption and ECDH key exchange. \r\n\r\nAnyone can generate Cloakcoin with annual interest rates of 6%.\r\n\r\nCloakcoin aims to allow any computer or smartphone user to participate in the cryptomarket with complete security and without the fear of unwanted hacking or multi-channel spying activity.","notice":null,"date_added":"2014-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
