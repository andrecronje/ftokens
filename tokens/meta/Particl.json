It is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain built on the latest Bitcoin codebase. It uses privacy protocols such as RingCT with Bulletproofs, CT, stealth addresses, SMSG, and encryption layers.\r\n\r\nPART is the native currency of the Open Marketplace, a decentralized and private marketplace running on Particl's blockchain. It charges no commission on sales, transaction fees, or subscription fees, bringing the costs of using the platform at a near-zero level.\r\n\r\nThe Open Marketplace is reportedly just as secure and private as the PART currency. No traceable, personal, or sales data can be collected by any third-party because none is generated in the first place. It claims to be the first online marketplace ever to be built from the ground up with privacy in mind.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-07-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
