It aims to tackle the problems of current blockchain technologies, especially limited transaction capacity and lack of use cases due to user-unfriendliness. TTC has reportedly implemented an optimized consensus mechanism called Multi-tier BFT-DPoS to ensure high transaction speed and Master/Slave network combination to provide near limitless scalability. \r\n\r\nTTC serves as the universal currency in the TTC ecosystem for four major utilities. First, TTC is rewarded to Representatives and Voters for consensus mining. Second, it is used to pay for the deployment of smart contracts. Third, TTC can be paid as Gas fees for asset transactions and usage of Slave networks. Lastly, it can be used to purchase services and products which integrates the TTC main network.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-08-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
