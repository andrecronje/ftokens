In order to perform a transaction, users only need a public and private key. Transactions are irreversible so as to prevent fraud. \r\n\r\nHNC migrated to the X11 hash algorithm (similar to DASH), allowing the Hellenic Coin network to benefit from its advantages whilst allowing the team to modify any parameters to better serve the needs of the platform. Time efficiency is another characteristic of Hellenic Coin, as users can reportedly make global payments within a few minutes. Hellenic coin addresses are fully transparent with no sensitive information attached.","notice":null,"date_added":"2015-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
