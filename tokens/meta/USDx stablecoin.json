It is pegged to a basket of selected stablecoins (35% USDC, 35% PAX and 30% TUSD), with constituents and weightings adjustable through on-chain governance. The bidirectional exchange (from constituents to USDx, and from USDx to a basket of constituents) are wholly on-chain and verifiable on Etherscan. \r\n\r\nUSDx has been integrated with Lendf.Me (a Money Market protocol of dForce) for interest-yielding and crypto loan applications. A yield-enhancing protocol will be launched to allow USDx holders to earn passive yields.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0xeb269732ab75a6fd61ea60b06fe994cd32a83549"},"category":"token"}
