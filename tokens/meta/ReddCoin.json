The Reddcoin API supports social platforms such as Reddit, Twitter, and Twitch. Accounts created on the Reddcoin wallet can be linked to Twitter, Twitch, and Reddit accounts. Upon downloading the ReddID browser extension, users can “like” content by entering the username and sending a micropayment. RDD is mined by the ReddID wallet through Proof-of-Stake-Velocity (PoSV), which incentivizes both ownership (stake) and activity (velocity).","notice":"Reddcoin (RDD) is executing a soft-fork consensus upgrade to move to its PoSV v2 staking algorithm. Users who have not upgraded to the [new wallet](https://www.reddcoin.com/2020/01/10/reddcoin-rdd-core-wallet-release-3-0-1/) are advised to do so.
