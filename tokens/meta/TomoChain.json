TomoChain reportedly features a 150-Masternodes architecture with Proof of Stake Voting (POSV) consensus for near-zero fees and instant transaction confirmations. Security, stability, and chain finality are reportedly guaranteed via techniques such as double validation, staking via smart-contracts, and uniform randomization processes.\r\n\r\nTomoChain supports all EVM-compatible smart-contracts, protocols, and atomic cross-chain token transfers. Scaling techniques such as sharding, EVM parallelisation, private-chain generation, hardware integration will be continuously researched and integrated into TomoChain. The project aims to become 'an ideal scalable smart-contract public blockchain for decentralized apps, token issuance, and token integration for small and big businesses'.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
