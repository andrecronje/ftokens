Its vision is to create a blockchain-powered decentralized internet that enables digital rights and secure transactions. Elastos uses the Internet as the base-layer infrastructure and separates network communications from application computing. It prohibits apps from directly accessing the network so as to prevent malicious attacks. Elastos is merged mined with Bitcoin to optimize energy efficiency and leverage the security of the Bitcoin network for Elastos applications. Sidechains are also included as an additional layer of security.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
