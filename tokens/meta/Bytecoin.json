The main goal of the project is to facilitate fast, anonymous, and untraceable transactions. Bytecoin claims to be the first project to implement CryptoNote technology. Its security reportedly comes from using ring signatures to protect a sender's identity and unlinkable addresses to prevent blockchain analysis. Bytecoin claims to have a block time of 2 minutes and adaptive parameters that are designed to make it easy to mine. Recent additions to Bytecoin technology include Auditable Wallets, which reportedly enables secure, publicly observable deposits, and Blockchain Gateways, a means of connecting Bytecoin's blockchain with other blockchains.","notice":null,"date_added":"2014-06-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
