GINcoin's (GIN) Freighter Fleet of masternodes are delivered via GIN Ecosystem Apps (GEA) Protocol. The GEA Protocol is reportedly a set of rules implemented by DAMs (Distributed Apps Marketplace) and by Freighters to create and monitor a decentralized Freighter Fleet. GIN's Freighter Fleet is envisaged as a support for running distributed apps or jobs in a decentralized system that aims to be resilient to single points of failure and control.\r\n\r\nThe GIN Platform is reportedly the first organization to adopt the protocol and enroll in the creation of the first DAM, which has demand for masternode deployment from its customers and would benefit from a distributed network of hosting providers. GIN is the native currency for the GIN Platform and works to provide support for transactions and governance through GIN masternodes.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
