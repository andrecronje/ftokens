For example, a node may make a request and pay tokens to request other nodes (or links) to provide resources such as power, network. data, and services. Through zero-knowledge proofs, optional masking may be used to protect user privacy.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
