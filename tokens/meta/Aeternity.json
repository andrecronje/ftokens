It was founded in 2017, and seeks to eliminate inefficiencies in the crypto market by increasing scalability of smart contracts and dApps, sharding, and off-chain contract execution. The Turing-complete smart contracts on the Aeternity chain allow for transaction execution without third parties or intermediaries. Aeternity also has state channels to enable off-chain smart contract settlements which only touch the blockchain should a disagreement in the contract arise, acting as a self-arbitrating crypto court. The Aeternity blockchain is also built upon state-of-the-art cryptographic data structures which give rise to robust efficiency, strong security, and the elimination “single point of failure” (SPOF) issues.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
