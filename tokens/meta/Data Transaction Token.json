It aims to facilitate efficient data transactions and the implementation of the transactionsâ€™ permanent records on the public blockchain.\r\n\r\nThe Scroll Project was established in 2017, originally starting as a peer to peer file-sharing application that sought to eliminate the risk of individual user data leaks and eventually grew into a software suite built around Distributed Ledger Technologies.\r\n\r\nThe digital asset, Data Transaction Token, is used to initiate private data transactions by users onto the public Ethereum Blockchain, rendering each transaction immutable.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-07-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x24dcc881e7dd730546834452f21872d5cb4b5293"},"category":"token"}
