It was designed to reduce the volumes of data that must be moved, the consequent traffic, and the distance the data must travel, providing lower latency and reduced transmission costs. \r\n\r\nThe Edge network aims to provide serverless infrastructure that is built using the spare capacity around its users. The $EDGE token enables the transfer of value from the consumers of network services to contributors to the network on a proof of work basis. The Edge network is maintained by Edge Network Technologies, a limited company registered and headquartered in London, England.","notice":"DADI has rebranded to Edge.
