The project seeks to address fraud and opaqueness in digital advertising.\r\n\r\nThe token aims to correctly price user attention within the platform. Advertisers pay BAT to website publishers for the attention of users. The BAT ecosystem includes Brave, an open-source, privacy-centered browser designed to block trackers and malware. It leverages blockchain technology to anonymously and track user attention securely and rewards publishers accordingly.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x0d8775f648430679a709e98d2b0cb6250d2887ef"},"category":"token"}
