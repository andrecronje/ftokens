For instance, it can issue crypto-based assets, denominated by “bitAsset”, that track real-world markets like the USD, such as the bitUSD. Each smart coin has at least 100% of its value backed by the BitShares’ native currency, the BTS, which can be converted at any time at an exchange rate set by a trustworthy price feed. Bitshares was created by Dan Larimer, the co-founder of EOS, Steemit, and Cryptonomex. BitShares also has its own decentralized exchange.","notice":null,"date_added":"2014-07-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
