Users can create and run crypto trading strategies on the cloud, 24/7, through a drag and drop editor. A MarketPlace is available and allows users to choose from hundreds of strategies created by the community. More experienced traders can create their own strategies with complex technical indicators (RSI, SMA, WMA, BOLL, MACD, ICHIMOKU, etc) without any programming knowledge using the visual editor.

It allows users to run strategies.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-07-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x464eBE77c293E473B48cFe96dDCf88fcF7bFDAC0"},"category":"token"}
