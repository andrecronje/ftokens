EthoFS is a decentralized website hosting platform which utilizes the node network for storage and bandwidth, DDoS protection, censorship-resistance, and reliability. Community-owned nodes share in data hosting revenue generated by the network. \r\n\r\nNode Types Available For Deployment:\r\n\r\n- Service Node (SN): Act as a data relay and secure the Ether-1 blockchain.\r\n- Masternode (MN): Provide storage and processing resources to the network and secure the Ether-1 blockchain.\r\n- Gateway Node (GN): Provide storage and processing resources to the network, secure the Ether-1 blockchain, and act a gateway to decentrally hosted ethoFS data on the network.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
