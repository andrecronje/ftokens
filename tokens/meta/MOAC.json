MOAC has a multichain architecture, with microchains built atop the MOAC base layer. The base layer supports tokenization, and uses the microchains to decentralize block processing (sharding) and to handle smart contracts. MOAC uses a Proof-of-Work system that allows miners to mine the main chain and sub-chains. Mining can also be done from mobile devices.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
