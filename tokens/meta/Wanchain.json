Its key features are cross-chain interoperability, privacy, and smart contract functionality. Wanchain connects and facilitates the transfer of value between different blockchains in a distributed fashion. Public or private blockchains can integrate with Wanchain to establish connections between different ledgers and perform inter-ledger asset transfers. The Wanchain ledger supports not only smart contracts, but also token exchange privacy protection. Use cases of the Wanchain include asset transfers, loan origination, and credit payments. Wanchain is part of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) and Blockchain Interoperability Alliance (BIA). The latter comprises ICON, Aion, and Wanchain and has the shared goal of promoting interconnectivity between isolated blockchain networks.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-03-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
