The blockchain micro-mining software can reportedly run on IoT devices to mine cryptocurrencies. According to the team, it can be embedded into different IoT chipsets and downloaded into existing IoT devices through a firmware update. The founding team reportedly has about 30 years of experience in the semiconductor and IoT hardware industries. AnApp, the developer behind IOTW was selected by 500 Startups (https://500.co) to participate in the 24th Batch Accelerator Program (Batch 24).","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x4fe327c5a809fa721d47b80c5038a0b393e61305"},"category":"token"}
