The Framework is a JavaScript library that reduces the time, resources, and issues of developing a dapp. The 0xcert Framework provides support for implementing both ERC-20 fungible tokens as well as ERC-721 non-fungible tokens. The mission is to provide a blockchain-agnostic platform for building dapps.\r\n\r\nZXC (fungible ERC-20 token) is the native utility token of the 0xcert protocol and was introduced to align issuing parties with dapps and the community. With the infrastructure built around the system of smart contracts, its primary role is to provide the incentive mechanisms and support the ecosystem with low fees.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found at the 0xcert website (https://0xcert.org/), GitHub (https://www.github.com/0xcert/framework), and the Framework Documentation (https://docs.0xcert.org).","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-07-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x83e2be8d114f9661221384b3a50d24b96a5653f5"},"category":"token"}
