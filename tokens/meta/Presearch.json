Presearch funds operations through what it describes as a 'transparent, unobtrusive advertising system' that enables advertisers and users to stake PRE on keywords. By doing so, they get to display advertisements on those keywords in the search results.\r\n\r\nPresearch is 100% free to use and Presearch rewards its users with PRE tokens for using Presearch like any other search engine. The office is located in the Toronto area, Ontario, Canada. According to Presearch, it has over 1.3 million users and one of the next steps of Presearch is to grow bigger in North America.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x88a3e4f35d64aad41a6d4030ac9afe4356cb84fa"},"category":"token"}
