It reportedly has a transaction speed of 1600 TPS, a simple account number (PASA), and an architecture which enables privacy. Pascal introduces a low-memory GPU- and ASIC-resistant hash algorithm called Random Hash. This CPU-native algorithm strives towards mining decentralization by combining hash primitives in a serial manner in conjunction with a branch-heavy and recursive implementation. Pascal uses a cryptographic data-structure known as the ‘SafeBox’ which functions as a dynamic ledger of all account balances.","notice":null,"date_added":"2016-12-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
