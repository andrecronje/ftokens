Mined blocks will make a compulsory 2.5% donation to the Einsteinium Foundation's fund and the community will vote on which scientific project to fund. With the integration of crowdfunding into the process, the Einsteinium Foundation aims to raise awareness for myriad projects and causes. To date, the Foundation has reportedly contributed 16M of EMC2 coins for science projects.\r\n\r\nEMC2 is a Scrypt coin that uses the Kimoto gravity well with a 50% block reduction and a 60 second block time to democratize the mining process. The EMC2 coin supports wallets for Windows, Mac, and Android.","notice":null,"date_added":"2014-04-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
