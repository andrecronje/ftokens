Matic aims to be the de-facto platform on which developers will deploy and run decentralized applications in a secure and decentralized manner. \r\n\r\nMatic Network claims to have worked on implementations of Plasma MVP (Minimum Viable Plasma), WalletConnect protocol, and the Ethereum event notification engine - Dagger. Matic intends to provide Matic wallet, payment APIs and SDKs, products and other solutions that will allow developers to design, implement, and migrate DApps built on platforms like Ethereum. Matic plans to support other blockchains in the future to offer interoperability alongside scalability to existing public blockchains.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x7D1AfA7B718fb893dB30A3aBc0Cfc608AaCfeBB0"},"category":"token"}
