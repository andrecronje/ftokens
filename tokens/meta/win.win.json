The project claims that there will be no fees for the direct peer-to-peer exchanges, as these transactions will be performed directly between user wallets. The TWINS cryptocurrency will reportedly be used to power the exchange platform for buy and sell order listings, as well as reward the hosting of network nodes.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
