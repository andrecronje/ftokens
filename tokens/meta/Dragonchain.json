The project started as the “Disney Private Blockchain Platform” and was later released as open-source software in 2016. DragonChain is providing the serverless ecosystem that allows companies to start using blockchain applications in an easy, private, and secure way. They aim to give businesses a “turn-key” product that is compatible with the development stack that companies are currently used to like Java, C++, and Python. This means that businesses will now be able to build their own smart contracts (on the DragonChain platform) using common programming languages.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-12-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x419c4db4b9e25d6db2ad9691ccb832c8d9fda05e"},"category":"token"}
