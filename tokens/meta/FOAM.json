FOAM incentivizes the infrastructure needed for privacy-preserving and fraud-proof location verification. The starting point for FOAM is the FOAM Map, where a community of Cartographers curate geographic Points of Interest on the FOAM map. Through global community-driven efforts, FOAMâ€™s proof of location protocol aims to enable a permissionless and privacy-preserving network of radio beacons that is independent from external centralized sources and capable of providing secure location verification services.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-12-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x4946fcea7c692606e8908002e55a582af44ac121"},"category":"token"}
