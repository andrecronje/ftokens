On the network, anyone can buy and sell bandwidth using the Orchid token (OXT). Users can browse privately and access content without being limited by their geography. With its decentralized design, multi-hop architecture, and Open Source ethos, Orchid offers users \"unprecedented digital privacy in a trustless context\". \r\n\r\nTheir first offering is the Orchid client, an open-source tool that allows users to explore the web with the privacy they need, served by an open marketplace for bandwidth built on Ethereum. This will display the nodes on the network and the user can choose which routes they want to take.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-12-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x4575f41308EC1483f3d399aa9a2826d74Da13Deb"},"category":"token"}
