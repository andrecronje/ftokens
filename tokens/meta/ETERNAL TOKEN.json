Its precursor was Eternal Coin (XEC), a non-blockchain based virtual currency, which was only available to authorized users in specific countries (e.g. South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Philippines). For non-residents of the aforementioned countries, Eternal Token (XET) can be used to acquire Eternal Coin (XEC) at a 1:10 ratio. Similar to XEC, XET is centralized in its operations in that transactions can be reversed.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-08-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x054c64741dbafdc19784505494029823d89c3b13"},"category":"token"}
