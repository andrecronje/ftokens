The primary focus of FreightTrust is to eliminate paper from supply chain operations and thereby help to streamline operations while cutting down on financial and resource waste. This will be achieved by implementing Smart Contract Bills of Lading as well as other digitized shipping documents. Additional features include predictive A.I., a blockchain audit trail, and on-chain payments and financial management.\r\n\r\nThe ARY token acts as a digital software license, which resides on the Ethereum platform.\r\n\r\nInitial primary target markets are the USA and EU due to their prominent trucking industries, with other global markets likely to be tackled later.\r\n\r\nBlock Array HQ is based in Chattanooga, TN. For more information on the token and platform please visit BlockArray.com and FreightTrust.net.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-01-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0xa5f8fc0921880cb7342368bd128eb8050442b1a1"},"category":"token"}
