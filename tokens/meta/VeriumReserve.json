The team claims that variable block-times allow Verium to scale automatically while enhancing transaction speeds and network capacity to ensure high levels of network security at any level of mining throughput. By linking the binary chain and Verium’s auxiliary mining protocol (AuxPOW), Verium will also process VeriCoin blocks. This protocol reportedly speeds up VeriCoin’s block-time to less than 30 seconds. These technologies reportedly enable VeriCoin’s network to provide an efficient and scalable system for consumer transactions. \r\n\r\nThe Dual Blockchain (or Binary-Chain) pairs a digital currency (VeriCoin) with a digital reserve (Verium). It aims to secure and accelerate transactions by leveraging complementary protocol technologies (Proof-of-Stake-Time and Proof-of-Work-Time) into a blockchain system. The goal is to offer a comprehensive solution to ensure low cost, secure, fast, and scalable digital transactions.","notice":null,"date_added":"2016-09-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
