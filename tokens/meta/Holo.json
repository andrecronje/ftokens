In Holochain, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This could translate into higher scalability for dapps hosted on Holochain. The Holo ecosystem relies on hosts that provide processing and storage for distributed applications while earning redeemable credits. Holochain Dapps can be developed with JavaScript or Lisp, with support for front-end systems using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0x6c6ee5e31d828de241282b9606c8e98ea48526e2"},"category":"token"}
