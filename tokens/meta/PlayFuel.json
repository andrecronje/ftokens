It is creating a platform that allows developers to earn funding by integrating PlayFuel into their games and allowing players to mine PLF just by playing. Players can use these tokens to buy games, redeem exclusive goodies, or even exchange the tokens for real money.\r\n\r\nDevelopers can gain funding through gamers who purchase PLF and invest in the development of their games. Investors get access to beta testing, exclusive in-game items, and will be one of the first users to be given access to the actual game.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0xaDA62f7CCd6af6cAcff04ACCBC4f56f3D4FFd4Ef"},"category":"token"}
