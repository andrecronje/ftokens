It is purportedly able to support 50K transactions per second and uses a Hybrid PoS + PoW consensus mechanism. The consensus mechanism makes use of value-added computation through the use of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computations. MATRIX Intelligent Contracts use Natural Language Programming and adaptive deep learning-based templates to auto-code. MAN tokens are mined and used to power real-world applications. The project has reportedly collaborated with Beijing cancer Research hospital to improve speed and accuracy of a cancer diagnosis.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-01-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
