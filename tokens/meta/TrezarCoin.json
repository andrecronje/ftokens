Trezarcoin has an energy-efficient hybrid PoW/PoS Blockchain, which provides security through its multi-algo implementations.\r\n\r\nThe design of the Trezarcoin Blockchain, especially the mining perspective, was chosen to allow anyone with no special hardware to either mine or stake Trezarcoins. Trezarcoin has a one minute block time. Difficulty adjustment is every block and is done by the OSS ( Orbitcoin-Super-Shield ).\r\n\r\n[TrezarMessage](https://trezarcoin.com/TrezarMessage.pdf) was developed by the Trezarcoin Team, which is a fully-encrypted messaging application that runs on the peer-to-peer layer of the Trezarcoin Blockchain. The team is decentralized, with the founder hailing from Germany.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-09-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
