GRAFT aims to democratize existing payment networks and become a ubiquitous alternative payment network alongside traditional choices like Visa and Mastercard. The network is reportedly decentralized and able to work across borders and regulatory environments.  \r\n\r\nWith respect to Point-of-Sale cryptocurrencies, the project claims to address privacy, speed, fees, and integration. The GRAFT blockchain is a dual-layer (Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake) blockchain with proof-of-stake based authorizations and service broker architecture.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
