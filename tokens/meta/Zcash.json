Zcash transactions can either be transparent or shielded through a zero-knowledge proof called zk-SNARKs. This allows the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the parties or amounts involved. Instead of publishing spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove that nobody is being dishonest.","notice":null,"date_added":"2016-10-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
