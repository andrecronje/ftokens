It seeks to bring users together so as to raise the quality of accessible education but at a reasonable cost. The ODEM platform lets qualified educators anywhere in the world create customized curriculum and educational programs that can equip students with practical knowledge. It then connects students with various educational hubs via a smart contract payment platform. The platform also allows students to submit custom curricula requests to ODEM educators for bidding, and can also provide students with more choices for housing, transportation, and other necessities. Upon the completion of each course, students will receive certificates that will also be posted to the blockchain.
