Enigma aims to extend Ethereum Smart Contracts by introducing secret contracts.\r\n\r\nSecret contracts would operate off-chain, meaning the execution of the contract doesn’t occur on the Ethereum blockchain, but rather sorts any related data into pieces, encrypts those pieces, and distributes them redundantly among Enigma nodes.","notice":null,"date_added":"2017-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0xf0ee6b27b759c9893ce4f094b49ad28fd15a23e4"},"category":"token"}
