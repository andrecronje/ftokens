Swaps are done through permissionless cross-chain liquidity pools that allow users to stake their assets to earn trading fees. Traders can monitor pool prices and earn by arbitraging back to fair market prices. Projects can reportedly stake their treasuries to give their tokens deep liquidity.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-07-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1839,"name":"Binance Coin","symbol":"BNB","slug":"binance-coin","token_address":" bnb1e4q8whcufp6d72w8nwmpuhxd96r4n0fstegyuy"},"category":"token"}
