Futurepia mainnet uses a patented consensus algorithm called the Dual Delegated Proof of Stake (DDPoS) algorithm which reportedly improves network speed without compromising security. The platform can reportedly handle up to 300,000 transactions per second (certified and tested by KOLAS). Futurepia aims to make developing on the blockchain easy in both Linux and Windows operating systems and provides over 100 APIs for decentralized application (DApp) development.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the platform is to become a global operating system for DApps with its own application marketplace, comparable to what IOS is to the mobile market (Apple Appstore). In April 2019, Futurepia launched its first DApp called SNAC (SNAC), a blockchain social network platform.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-06-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
