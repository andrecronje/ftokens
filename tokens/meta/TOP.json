Powered by a three-layered ledger architecture consisting of a main chain, service chains, and off-chain ledgers, the team claims that TOP Chain is capable of handling real-world business applications. TOP Chain applies technologies such as a two-layer lattice DAG, two-layer sharding, and a parallel pBFT-PoS consensus mechanism, which would reportedly enable a single chain to process 300,000+ transactions per second.  \r\n\r\nTOP Chain aims to offer a reliable platform for services that demand high-frequency transactions such as communication, gaming, social media, big data, artificial intelligence, and IoT. The long-term mission of TOP Network is to build a public blockchain infrastructure for all DApps. TOP Network has developed HiWallet, a cryptocurrency wallet, and is developing a series of blockchain games along with several DApps.\r\n\r\nThe team claims that 80M+ global users will be progressively migrated from the pre-existing communications Apps—Dingtone, CoverMe, and SkyVPN—to TOP Chain.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-03-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0xdcD85914b8aE28c1E62f1C488E1D968D5aaFfE2b"},"category":"token"}
