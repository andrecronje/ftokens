A fault-tolerant system is designed to ensure a system remains fully functional even when part of it is ‘down’ or unavailable. ProximaX will build a P2P cloud storage architecture with fault tolerance and a distributed database by removing the central entity and connecting all the servers (or nodes) in a mesh configuration. Failure of any single component of the mesh will have minimal effect upon the overall performance of the system. ProximaX protocol will ensure confidentiality and integrity of the data passing through a myriad of nodes. The use of distributed databases (DHT) ensures consistency and integrity throughout the network.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":873,"name":"NEM","symbol":"XEM","slug":"nem","token_address":"prx"},"category":"token"}
