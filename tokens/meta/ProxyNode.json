ProxyNode seeks to build a blockchain-driven VPS and VPN services solution. Participants in the ProxyNode ecosystem are incentivised with PRX through the running of masternodes and coin staking. The immediate goals of the PRX team are to (i) build an MN hosting service (with fees paid in PRX), (ii) Launch a VPS service (VPS 4 PRX) allowing PRX payments, (iii) offer a VPN service (VPN 4 PRX) for PRX paid subscriptions and (iv) PRX-Change; An exchange for PRX traders that ensures equal global access to PRX. These projects are pursued in collaboration with MASC and form part of an overarching goal. Currently, ProxyNode has a maximum supply of 275,000,000 PRX.
