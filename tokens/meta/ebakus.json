From a technology perspective, it has DPOS consensus that reportedly allows it to scale with low latency, a new way of handling transaction fees, and an in-contract decentralized Database (ebakusDB). It is backwards compatible with ethereumâ€™s go-ethereum API(geth) and the EVM. \r\n\r\nIn ebakus, user transaction fees are free.
