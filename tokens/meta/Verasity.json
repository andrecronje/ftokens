Verasity.io purportedly offers a patent-pending Video Player that enables VRA rewards, monetization, and loyalty schemes within the video player wallet. The project claims that its technology is available to 280,000 video publishers with 240 million users and 50 billion monthly views. The goal is to bring engagement, audiences, and revenues back to video publisher sites from YouTube. Its attention-based model seeks to create a VRA token economy between viewers, video publishers, and advertisers.","notice":"Markets for VRA from Coinall have been identified by the project team as unsupported.
