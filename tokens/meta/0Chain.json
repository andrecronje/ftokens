It reportedly offers a cheaper, faster, and more secure storage than traditional cloud with continuous blockchain-verified data protection. \r\n\r\nDevelopers can reportedly use 0Chain dStorage (0Chainnet) via their SDK to protect customer data at a low cost and better performance. 0Chain LLC has reportedly produced the first dApp which runs on top of 0Chainnet (0ChainNet is built from scratch with Golang). The dApp is called 0Box and it is a Dropbox-style, trustless private cloud which does not require any logins or emails. User data is backed up with the assurance of privacy, transparency, and anonymity.\r\n\r\nZCN is a cryptoasset tied to data and is used for storage. The value of ZCN is based on data stored on the network. Token holders receive \"free\" services (storage, transactions) by locking ZCN. 0Wallet reportedly protects ZCN assets with serverless 2FA using mobile and laptop.  User assets will reportedly remain safe even if either device gets compromised,","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0xb9ef770b6a5e12e45983c5d80545258aa38f3b78"},"category":"token"}
