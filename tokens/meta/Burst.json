With a block time of 4 minutes and support for multi-out and multi-out same transactions, the maximum transaction throughput of the Burst blockchain is around 80tps. \r\n\r\nBurst also claims to be the first blockchain to implement Turing-complete smart contracts, which come with BlockTalk, a Java compiler. Smart contracts on the Burst blockchain can be used, among others, to deploy on-chain games, create non-fungible tokens (https://kohinoor.blockplay.io/). \r\n\r\nThe Burst platform also offers the issuance and trading of assets, a built-in marketplace, an alias system for easier transactions, and encrypted on-chain messaging. The project's development is driven by volunteers (Burst Application Team - BAT) and is complemented by community members pushing retail adoption and marketing (Burst marketing Fund - BMF). The dApp ecosystem of Burst includes CloudBurst - a dApp which stores arbitrary data on the chain.","notice":null,"date_added":"2014-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
