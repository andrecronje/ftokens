The project uses the Hierarchical Hybrid Consensus Mechanism (HHCM), which amalgamates elements from PoW, PoS, and parallel computing with the goal of creating an efficient and safe platform. \r\n\r\nNotably, Fusion leverages what it dubs 'Distributed Control Right Management' as a security layer that protects cryptoassets on the Fusion blockchain. The distributed storage and sharding of a private key ensures means that no single node can gain control of assets. \r\n\r\nFusion also provides for multiple triggering modes, such as time and event-based triggers, into its smart contracts, which were designed to meet the demands of complex financial smart contracts. \r\n\r\nFusion is led by Dejun Qian, who also founded BitSE, a blockchain incubator that facilitated the rise of VeChain and QTUM.","notice":"We have received reports that Huobi has [temporarily suspended](https://huobiglobal.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000545561-Announcement-on-the-Suspension-of-the-Deposit-and-Withdrawal-of-FSN) withdrawals and deposits of FSN due to technical issues.","date_added":"2018-02-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0xd0352a019e9ab9d757776f532377aaebd36fd541"},"category":"token"}
