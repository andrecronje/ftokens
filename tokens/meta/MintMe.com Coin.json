MintMe Coin was launched as Webchain and later rebranded to better represent the focus of the coin. MintMe Coin has an egalitarian approach to mining, which is why it was created as a CPU minable coin to be mined via websites and on devices with computational resources (Internet of Things). MintMe encourages people to help others through mutually-beneficial donations.","notice":null,"date_added":"2018-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
