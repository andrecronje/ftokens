To achieve this, Elrond introduces two features: Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a reportedly fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can reportedly process upwards of 10,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 5-second latency, and negligible cost. It aims to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-07-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1839,"name":"Binance Coin","symbol":"BNB","slug":"binance-coin","token_address":" bnb1m5uzzfxs7x05sl28gg96zyecn9jwgtkpyeftyn"},"category":"token"}
