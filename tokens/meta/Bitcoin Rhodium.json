Bitcoin Rhodiumâ€™s goal is to be a premier store-of-value coin. The project uses its own blockchain (not a fork) and reportedly has a Strong Hands Program, a program that grants holders a share of the unclaimed airdrop coins over the course of 8 years, without the need to register. XRC will be the base currency used for future projects, such as a P2P Precious Metals market. \r\n\r\nBitcoin Rhodium uses its blockchain with a total supply of 2.1 million XRC. It is programmed in C# language and is POW only.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-04-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"platform":null,"category":"coin"}
