It aims to offer Instant access to cash without selling: the crypto-backed loan is based on the market value of the crypto assets. It also aims to allow users to earn daily interest on digital assets via deposits. The ZEON Wallet is an Ethereum and Bitcoin wallet which can be installed on Google Chrome, iOS, and Android.  The project plans to introduce a contactless payment card in 2020 to enable users to spend the ZEON token like traditional money. The ZEON team is reportedly developing its own public high-throughput blockchain platform with sharding.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0xe5b826ca2ca02f09c1725e9bd98d9a8874c30532"},"category":"token"}
