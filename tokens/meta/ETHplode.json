Whenever $ETHPLO is transferred, 0.5% of the amount is burned. According to the team, this self-destructive functionality increases the asset's scarcity over time and is hardcoded directly into its monetary structure. ETHplode is based on the design of the Bomb token â€“ a hyper-deflationary, self-destructing currency.","notice":null,"date_added":"2019-07-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":null,"platform":{"id":1027,"name":"Ethereum","symbol":"ETH","slug":"ethereum","token_address":"0xe0c6ce3e73029f201e5c0bedb97f67572a93711c"},"category":"token"}
